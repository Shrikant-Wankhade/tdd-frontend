//core principle of TDD is always do the simplest thing to pass the test
//We could rephrase this as always do the simplest thing to fix the error youâ€™re working on


//The describe function defines a test suite
//which is simply a set of tests with a given name

//The first argument is the name of the unit you are testing. It could be a React component, a function, or a module. 
//The second argument is a function inside of which you define your tests

/*
  A great test is not just good but is also the following:

 Short
 Descriptive
 Independent of other tests
 Has no side effects



 A good test has the following three distinct sections:

Arrange: Sets up test dependencies
Act: Executes production code under test
Assert: Checks that expectations are met
